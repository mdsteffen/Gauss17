<h1>About</h1>
<p>Gauss-17 is an HTML5 canvas based compass and straightedge drawing tool. It
allows users to practice compass and straightedge constructions with sub-pixel
accuracy. Unique to this tool is the automatic calculation of line intersections
and the ability to "snap" drawing tools to those intersections. At its core,
Gauss-17 is a basic 2-D CAD program with a very limited toolset and a user
interface that mimics the use of standard compass and straightedge tools.

<h1>A Brief History</h1>
<p>Using a compass and straightedge, the ancients knew how to construct
triangles, squares, and pentagons, and any figure that comes from dividing
those sides by two (hexagons, octagons, 10-gons, etc.). In 1796
Gauss proved that it was possible to construct a 17-gon and 5 years later he gave
a formula for a set of N-gons which are construtible (these were later proven to be
the only constructible N-gons). The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass-and-straightedge_construction">mathematics
behind constructible angles</a> is worth a read.

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>Tool selection is accomplished using the tool radio buttons. Available
tools are: compass, straightedge, and selection. The compass tool
is used for drawing circles and circle segments, the straightedge is used for drawing
line segments, and the selection tool is used for selecting drawn objects,
primarily for deletion.

<p>The curser can be set to "snap" to intersections, lines, circle segments, and center
points of circles. This allows for precise compass and straightedge placement
and settings. There are times where snapping to an intersection, for example,
can interfere with the desired placement of a tool, so this "snapping" behavior
can be turned off with the appropriate checkboxes.

<h2>Compass Tool</h2>
<img src="images/circle.png">
<p>The compass tool has two points which define the settings. To set the compass center
point, drag the green X to the desired center. To set the radius, drag the red
X point to the desired distance from the center point. Once the radius has been
set, moving the green center point will maintain that radius. To draw a circle segment,
click and drag anywhere (except on the red or green X) to start tracing out
the circle segment. Release the mouse to finish drawing. Notice the mouse curser
follows the compass circle as you move the mouse around the center point.

<h2>Straightedge Tool</h2>
<img src="images/line_segment.png">
<p>The straightedge tool also has two points which define the settings. Drag the
red and green points to the desired location to define a line. To draw a line segment,
click and drag anywhere (except on the red or green X) to start tracing out the
line segment. Release the mouse to finish drawing. Notice the mouse curser follows
the defined line as you move your mouse on the screen. If trying to draw a line
between two points (with the red and green X marks on those points), it is often
helpful to start tracing from the middle of the line, then drag toward one X and
then toward the other.

<h2>Selection Tool</h2>
<p>The selection tool is used primarily to select a drawn object to then be deleted.
To select an object, click near the object. The selected object will be drawn
in red. To delete the object, click the "Delete" button on the screen.

<h1>Basic Operations</h1>
<p>Aside from creating circles and line segments as described above, other basic
operations include: constructing a diameter of a circle, finding the midpoint
between two points, constructing a perpendicular line, and bisecting an angle.

<h3>Creating the diameter/radius of a circle</h3>
<img src="images/diameter1.png">
<p>By default, this tool will allow you to snap a tool to the center of drawn circles
and circle segments. Creating a circle diameter is then easy. First use the compass
tool to draw a circle. Then with the line segment tool selected, snap one point
to the circle center and the other to any point on the circle. Use these settings
to draw a line through the circle. The segment between where this line intersects
the circle is a diameter. The segment from the circle center to the edge is a radius.

<p>
<img src="images/diameter2.png">
<p>Alternately, if you aren't able to snap to the center of a circle, you will
first need to have a point defined for the center of the circle. This can be done
by intersecting any two lines. After the center has been defined, proceed as above
using the intersection as the center of the circle. Only a portion of the diameter has
been shown here.

<h3>Finding the midpoint between two points</h3>
<img src="images/midpoint.png">
<p>To create a midpoint between two points A and B, first draw the line segment AB. Next set the
compass to be centered at A with radius larger than the half the length of AB. Draw a circle
(or segments) from one side of AB to the other side. Keeping the radius of the compass the
same, draw another circle (or segments) with the compass centered at B. The two circle segments
intersect at points P and Q. Select the straightedge tool and and place the X marks on
point P and Q. Draw a line segment which crosses AB. The intersection of this line segment
with AB is the midpoint of AB.

<h3>Constructing a perpendicular line</h3>
<img src="images/perpendicular.png">
<p>Constructing a perpendicular line at a point P is very similar to finding a
midpoint, but in reverse. Center the compass tool on point P on a line and create
points A and B on the line, equidistant from point P. Center the compass on
point A with radius larger than AP. Draw a segment of the circle on one side of the
line. Keeping the radius of the compass the same, center the compass at B and draw
another segment of a circle. Call the intersection of the two circle segments Q.
Select the straightedge tool and place the red and green X marks on points P and Q.
The line segments drawn with these settings will be perpendicular to the original
line.

<h3>Bisecting an angle</h3>
<img src="images/bisect.png">
<p>Given two lines that intersect at point P, the angle between these lines
can be bisected. Center the compass tool on point P and create points A and B
on the two lines, equidistant from point P. Next center the compass on point
A (the radius need not be the same as before) and draw a circle segment near
the middle of the angle. Do the same with the compass centered at point B.
Call the intersection of the two circle segments Q. Select the straightedge
tool and place the red and green X marks on points P and Q. The line segment
drawn with these settings will bisect the angle APB.
